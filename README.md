To play this game you need two players. Goal is to get 100 points. If you are lucky enough to get it first - you will be the winner.

You have to roll the dice and sum the number the dice's side shows to your current score. 
However, if after multiple series of lucky rolls you
will get the dice's side that shows one point - 
you will lose your current score and it's your opponent who will test his/her luck.
